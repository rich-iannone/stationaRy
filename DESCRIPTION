Title: Detailed Meteorological Data from Stations All Over the World
Version: 0.5.0
Description: Acquire hourly meteorological data from stations located all over
    the world. There is a wealth of data available, with historic weather data
    accessible from nearly 30,000 stations. The available data is automatically
    downloaded from a data repository and processed into a 'tibble' for the
    exact range of years requested. A relative humidity approximation is
    provided using the 'August-Roche-Magnus' formula, which was adapted from
    Alduchov and Eskridge (1996) <doi:10.1175%2F1520-0450%281996%29035%3C0601%3AIMFAOS%3E2.0.CO%3B2>.
